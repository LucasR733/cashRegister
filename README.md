Coded by Lucas Routhier and Atom Olson

This program simulates a cash register. It takes input from a text file(items.txt), and adds each item with the price to the shopping cart.
Once done the program will print the receipt in a uniform manner.
Some features of this program include tax input(user can decide what the tax rate is), donation input(user can decide to round to next dollar to donate or donate a whole number ammount.), discount input(user can input how big of a discount the items will recieve and how often it occurs(50%, 10%, etc.)).
